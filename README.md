RoR2 mod - provides customizable players respawn system for your games

Mod will provide respawn system which can be configured to your play style. It allows for time respawn, respawn on start of teleporter event, respawn on end of teleporter event. 
You can customize respawn timer settings to scale with stage or game time. Respawns can be blocked at certain stages and during the teleporter to maintain the challenge that the game should provide.
